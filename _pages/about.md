I am a lecturer in the buesiness school of Brunel University London. Prior to this role, I served as a lecturer at Southwest University, China. I earned my PhD degree in Management Science and Engineering from Beihang University, China. During my academic journey, I had the privilege of being a visiting PhD student and a visiting scholar at the University of Edinburgh for two separate years.

My primary research in recent years focus lies in cash-flow inventory management, where I leverage mathematical modeling and computer programming to address complex challenges. I also did some works in traditional inventory management and routing problems.
