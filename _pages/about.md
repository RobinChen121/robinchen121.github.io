I am a lecturer in the buesiness school of Brunel University London. Prior to this role, I served as a lecturer at Southwest University, China. I earned my PhD degree in Management Science and Engineering from Beihang University, China. During my academic journey, I had the privilege of being a visiting PhD student and a visiting scholar at the University of Edinburgh for two separate years.

My primary research in recent years focus lies in cash-flow inventory management, where I leverage mathematical modeling and computer programming to address complex challenges. I also did some works in traditional inventory management and routing problems.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
