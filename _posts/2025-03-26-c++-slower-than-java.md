While implementing a dynamic programming solution in C++, I used a recursive function combined with an `unordered_map` to store intermediate results. Surprisingly, I found that in some cases, the C++ implementation ran slower than the Java version using `ConcurrentSkipListMap`—especially when the hash keys were composed of multiple floating-point numbers.

After consulting a few AI tools, `Grok` provided the most insightful explanation, pointing out several potential causes:

- **Hashing overhead**: When keys are combinations of floating-point numbers, computing their hashes can be computationally expensive. In recursive functions, this overhead accumulates quickly, especially when the key distribution is uneven.
  
- **Hash collision and performance degradation**: Tiny differences in floating-point values or clustered key distributions may lead to frequent hash collisions. This can degrade the average time complexity of operations (insert, lookup, delete) from $O(1)$ to $O(n)$.

- **Memory management**: In C++, `unordered_map` may trigger costly memory reallocations due to rehashing during recursive calls—more so than the dynamic adjustment overhead of a skip list like `ConcurrentSkipListMap`.

- **Lack of concurrency**: If recursion involves multithreading, `unordered_map` requires manual locking, whereas `ConcurrentSkipListMap` is designed for concurrency with a lock-free architecture, making it more efficient.

Among these, I believe the second point is the most likely cause. Specifically, for C++'s `unordered_map`, several floating-point-specific issues may contribute:

- **Floating-point precision**: The binary representation of floating-point numbers can introduce minuscule differences (e.g., `1.0` vs `1.0 + ε`), requiring normalization or truncation. Without this, hash collisions become more frequent.

- **Hash function quality**: Default or naive custom hash functions often struggle with clustered floating-point values, resulting in uneven distributions and degraded performance to $O(n)$.

- **Computational cost**: Repeated computation of complex hashes for combinations of floating-point numbers within recursion adds significant CPU overhead.

In contrast, Java's `ConcurrentSkipListMap` has structural advantages:

- **No hashing required**: Skip lists rely on comparisons instead of hashing, avoiding both collision-related slowdowns and the cost of hash computation.

- **Straightforward floating-point comparison**: While precision issues still exist, value comparisons are more intuitive, and the skip list's $O(\log n)$ performance remains stable regardless of key distribution.
